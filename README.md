# Simple React Starter

Okay, you know the drill:

```
npm install
npm start
```

That will get the dev server up and running at `localhost:8080`. If you want to build and minify just run:

```
npm run build
```

Thats basically it. I just wanted a simple (yet modern) react setup that I understood.
